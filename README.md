# DirectedTestExamples
Examples of directed java/c++ tests for algorithm problems.

Files: Combinations(java/c++)

(1) I added unitTest() and directedTests() functions for each of the files.
(2) Generated ArrayList/Vectors to perform the directed tests on. 5 of them are correct, and should cause no problems. However, I also created 2 "wrong" expected results to test the display of the error message. Programs terminate on wrong results.
(3) Added a directedTets() function call at the top main, right underneath smallTest().

NOTE: In the java files, 'package com.epi' is commented out so that I can run the files without that package. That's just a heads up in case you decide to copy and test these programs.
